Current Instructions:
----------------
`instructions/part_5.pdf`


Hi Everyone!
------------

This is going to be your repository for a project that spans
our time learning django.

Instructor Code
--------------

Instead of copy and pasting from the PDF, it will
be easier and avoid problems if you simply copy and paste
from real code. Note that it uses 4 spaces for indentation.

Getting Started
---------------

 - __fork__ it
 - __clone__ it
 - add the instructors remote:
   `git remote add instructors https://github.com/aiti-ghana-2012/django-blog-project.git`
 - There will be instructions for the first part in the file part_1.pdf in the instructions folder.
